# 🧮 Project Title: Equipment Borrowing Management System

**Developer:** Akaliza M. Racia

**Student ID:** 26628


## 📝 Introduction

In educational institutions, research labs, and office environments, equipment like laptops, projectors, and lab tools are frequently borrowed by students or employees. Unfortunately, poor tracking methods often result in lost items, overdue returns, and administrative confusion.

The Equipment Borrowing Management System is designed to solve these issues using a structured, PL/SQL-based solution. It automates the process of borrowing and returning equipment, enforces accountability, and helps organizations maintain better control over their valuable resources.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The main goal of this system is to track the movement of equipment between users and inventory. This includes recording when an item is borrowed, by whom, for how long, and whether it was returned on time. It reduces manual tracking and adds a layer of responsibility for all parties involved.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Automate equipment borrowing and return processes

- ✅ Track each borrowing transaction for transparency

- ✅ Notify users about due dates and overdue items

- ✅ Maintain a database of borrowing records and penalties

 # Phase 3:  🗂 Logical Model Design
 
## 📘 Phase Cover – What’s Included in Phase III?

In Phase III, the focus is on designing a Logical Data Model that reflects both the problem statement defined in Phase I and the business process modeled in Phase II. The logical model will structure data entities, their attributes, relationships, and constraints. This model is foundational for the implementation phase that follows.

## 🎯 Purpose:

 - To define how data will be organized, related, and constrained within the system

 - To reduce redundancy and ensure consistency using normalization principles

 - To visualize relationships between entities before coding begins

## 1️⃣ Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

Below are the core entities, their attributes (with data types), and key designations:

## 👥 Users

| Attribute      | Data Type    | Constraints                   |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `User_ID`      | INT          | PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE |
| `Name`         | VARCHAR(100) | NOT NULL                      |
| `Department`   | VARCHAR(100) | NOT NULL                      |
| `Contact_Info` | VARCHAR(150) | NOT NULL, UNIQUE              |

## 💻 Equipment

| `Name`                | VARCHAR(100) | NOT NULL                                                |
| `Type`                | VARCHAR(50)  | NOT NULL                                                |
| `Condition`           | VARCHAR(50)  | DEFAULT 'Good', CHECK IN ('Good', 'Fair', 'Damaged')    |
| `Availability_Status` | VARCHAR(20)  | DEFAULT 'Available', CHECK IN ('Available', 'Borrowed') |

## 📄 Borrowing Records

| Attribute      | Data Type   | Constraints                                                      |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Borrow_ID`    | INT         | PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE                                    |
| `User_ID`      | INT         | FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(User\_ID), NOT NULL                 |
| `Equipment_ID` | INT         | FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Equipment(Equipment\_ID), NOT NULL        |
| `Borrow_Date`  | DATE        | NOT NULL                                                         |
| `Due_Date`     | DATE        | NOT NULL, CHECK (`Due_Date` > `Borrow_Date`)                     |
| `Return_Date`  | DATE        | NULL (optional)                                                  |
| `Status`       | VARCHAR(20) | DEFAULT 'Borrowed', CHECK IN ('Borrowed', 'Returned', 'Overdue') |

## 💸 Fines

| Attribute     | Data Type     | Constraints                                      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Fine_ID`     | INT           | PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE                    |
| `User_ID`     | INT           | FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(User\_ID), NOT NULL |
| `Amount`      | DECIMAL(10,2) | NOT NULL, CHECK (`Amount` >= 0), DEFAULT 0.00    |
| `Reason`      | VARCHAR(150)  | NOT NULL                                         |
| `Paid_Status` | VARCHAR(20)   | DEFAULT 'Unpaid', CHECK IN ('Paid', 'Unpaid')    |

## 2️⃣ Relationships & Constraints

| Relationship          | Type        | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Users ↔ Borrowing     | One-to-Many | A user can have many borrow records           |
| Equipment ↔ Borrowing | One-to-Many | Each equipment can be borrowed multiple times |
| Users ↔ Fines         | One-to-Many | A user can be associated with multiple fines  |

## 3️⃣ Normalization

✅ 1NF – All attributes have atomic values
✅ 2NF – All non-key attributes fully depend on the primary key
✅ 3NF – No transitive dependencies exist; all non-key fields depend only on the PK

Example:

 - Borrowing and fine details are separated into their own tables.

 - Redundancy like repeating user/equipment info in transactions is avoided.

## 4️⃣ Handling Real-World Data Scenarios

## This model accommodates:

 - 🧾 Multiple borrowings by the same user

 - 🔁 Repeated borrowing of the same equipment

 - ⏰ Overdue returns, triggering fines

 - 📬 Future extensions (e.g., automated notifications)

Each entity can scale with more data while maintaining consistency and supporting business rules effectively.

## 5️⃣ Presentation & Feedback

✅ Logical model is designed for clarity and completeness
✅ Well-documented table structures with constraints
✅ Ready for submission and instructor feedback

#### 4. Set the Session Container

```sql
SQL> ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = wed_26628__equipment_borrowing_db;

Session altered.
```

* **Purpose:** Switches the session to the newly created PDB for subsequent operations.


### 5.User Creation and Privilege Assignment

#### Create a Database User

```sql
SQL> CREATE USER akaliza IDENTIFIED BY akaliza;

User created.
```

* **Purpose:** Creates a new user, akaliza, with the password akaliza.

#### Grant Basic Privileges

```sql
SQL> GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, DBA, SYSDBA TO akaliza;

Grant succeeded.
```

*  **Purpose:** To assigns full privileges for database operations.

# 🧾 Phase 5: Table Implementation & Data Insertion

## 📘 Introduction

In this phase, we bring together the results of all previous phases — from problem analysis, process modeling, and logical design — into a working physical database using Oracle SQL.

This step focuses on:

 - 💽 Building the database structure from the ERD

 - 🧪 Inserting sample data for testing and demonstration

 - 🛡️ Enforcing data integrity through constraints

 - 📈 Enabling queries and future analytics via a consistent structure

It represents the first functional version of the Equipment Borrowing Management System, ready for interaction and validation.

## 🧱 1. Table Creation

Using the logical model from Phase III, we created the following tables with full constraint support:

## 👥 Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
  User_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  Department VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  Contact_Info VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
```
## 💻 Equipment Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Equipment (
  Equipment_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  Type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  Condition VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Good' CHECK (Condition IN ('Good', 'Fair', 'Damaged')),
  Availability_Status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Available' CHECK (Availability_Status IN ('Available', 'Borrowed'))
);
```
## 📄 Borrowing Records Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Borrowing_Records (
  Borrow_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  User_ID INT NOT NULL,
  Equipment_ID INT NOT NULL,
  Borrow_Date DATE NOT NULL,
  Due_Date DATE NOT NULL,
  Return_Date DATE,
  Status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Borrowed' CHECK (Status IN ('Borrowed', 'Returned', 'Overdue')),
  FOREIGN KEY (User_ID) REFERENCES Users(User_ID),
  FOREIGN KEY (Equipment_ID) REFERENCES Equipment(Equipment_ID),
  CHECK (Due_Date > Borrow_Date) 
);
```
## 💸 Fines Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Fines (
  Fine_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  User_ID INT NOT NULL,
  Amount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00 CHECK (Amount >= 0),
  Reason VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  Paid_Status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Unpaid' CHECK (Paid_Status IN ('Paid', 'Unpaid')),
  FOREIGN KEY (User_ID) REFERENCES Users(User_ID)
);
```
## 📥 2. Data Insertion

Five meaningful records were added to each table to simulate realistic operations:

## 👥 Insert into Users
```sql
INSERT INTO Users VALUES (1, 'Lyna ', 'IT Department', 'lyna@gmail.com');
INSERT INTO Users VALUES (2, 'Ben ', 'Science Lab', 'ben@gmail.com');
INSERT INTO Users VALUES (3, 'Gloria ', 'Engineering', 'gloria@gmail.com');
INSERT INTO Users VALUES (4, 'Daniel ', 'Architecture', 'daniel@gmail.com');
INSERT INTO Users VALUES (5, 'Eve ', 'Business', 'eve@gmail.com');
```
## 💻 Insert into Equipment
```sql
INSERT INTO Equipment VALUES (101, 'Dell Laptop', 'Laptop', 'Good', 'Available');
INSERT INTO Equipment VALUES (102, 'Canon Camera', 'Camera', 'Fair', 'Available');
INSERT INTO Equipment VALUES (103, 'Epson Projector', 'Projector', 'Good', 'Borrowed');
INSERT INTO Equipment VALUES (104, 'Multimeter', 'Lab Tool', 'Damaged', 'Available');
INSERT INTO Equipment VALUES (105, 'MacBook Pro', 'Laptop', 'Good', 'Available');
```
## 📄 Insert into Borrowing_Records
```sql
INSERT INTO Borrowing_Records VALUES (201, 1, 101, TO_DATE('2025-05-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2025-05-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), NULL, 'Borrowed');
INSERT INTO Borrowing_Records VALUES (202, 2, 103, TO_DATE('2025-05-03', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2025-05-12', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2025-05-11', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Returned');
INSERT INTO Borrowing_Records VALUES (203, 3, 102, TO_DATE('2025-04-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2025-05-05', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2025-05-08', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Overdue');
INSERT INTO Borrowing_Records VALUES (204, 1, 104, TO_DATE('2025-05-04', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2025-05-14', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), NULL, 'Borrowed');
INSERT INTO Borrowing_Records VALUES (205, 5, 105, TO_DATE('2025-05-02', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2025-05-09', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2025-05-09', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Returned');
```
## 💸 Insert into Fines
```sql
INSERT INTO Fines VALUES (301, 3, 50.00, 'Late return of camera', 'Unpaid');
INSERT INTO Fines VALUES (302, 2, 0.00, 'Returned on time', 'Paid');
INSERT INTO Fines VALUES (303, 5, 0.00, 'Good standing', 'Paid');
INSERT INTO Fines VALUES (304, 1, 10.00, 'Slight delay in return', 'Unpaid');
INSERT INTO Fines VALUES (305, 4, 0.00, 'No penalties yet', 'Unpaid');
```
## 🔐 3. Data Integrity Assurance

✔️ Primary keys, foreign keys, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, and `DEFAULT` constraints are all enforced.

✔️ Sample data reflects realistic system use: borrowed items, overdue returns, and generated fines.

✔️ All references between tables are valid (e.g., `User_ID` and `Equipment_ID` exist before they're used).

## 🏗️ 4. Physical Database Structure

The logical data model from Phase III is now fully implemented in Oracle SQL:

  - 🔢 Structured data types

  - 🔐 Enforced constraints for consistency

 - 🔁 Referential integrity across tables

 - 🧱 A solid foundation for building PL/SQL procedures, triggers, and reports in future 
      phases

## 🧪 5. Sample Queries for Testing

### 🔍 A. Borrowed Equipment with User Details

```sql
SELECT U.Name, E.Name AS Equipment, B.Borrow_Date, B.Due_Date, B.Status
FROM Borrowing_Records B
JOIN Users U ON B.User_ID = U.User_ID
JOIN Equipment E ON B.Equipment_ID = E.Equipment_ID;
```
### 💸 B. Fines by User

```sql
SELECT U.Name, F.Amount, F.Reason, F.Paid_Status
FROM Fines F
JOIN Users U ON F.User_ID = U.User_ID;
```
📊 C. Equipment Availability Summary

```sql
SELECT Availability_Status, COUNT(*) AS Total
FROM Equipment
GROUP BY Availability_Status;
```

# 🔄 Phase 6: Database Interaction & Transactions

## 📘 Phase Cover – What’s Included in Phase VI?

In this phase, our database evolves from a static container of data into an intelligent, responsive system. We implement:
- 🎯 Database operations (DML & DDL)
- 🧠 Procedural logic with functions and exception handling
- ⚙️ Modular packages for organization
- 🧪 Testing to ensure robustness

---

## ✏️ 1. Database Operations

### 📥 DML (Data Manipulation Language)

#### 🧾 `INSERT`
```sql
INSERT INTO Fines VALUES (306, 1, 25.00, 'Late return of projector', 'Unpaid');
```
*Adds a fine for late return.*

#### ✍️ `UPDATE`
```sql
UPDATE Equipment SET Availability_Status = 'Available' WHERE Equipment_ID = 103;
```
*Marks the projector as returned.*

#### 🗑️ `DELETE`
```sql
DELETE FROM Borrowing_Records WHERE Borrow_ID = 204;
```
*Removes an incorrect transaction.*

---

### 🏗️ DDL (Data Definition Language)

#### 🧱 `CREATE`
```sql
CREATE TABLE Audit_Log (
  Log_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Action VARCHAR2(100),
  Timestamp DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);
```
*Creates a table for system audit logs.*

#### 🔧 `ALTER`
```sql
ALTER TABLE Equipment ADD Manufacturer VARCHAR2(100);
```
*Adds manufacturer info to the Equipment table.*

#### 💣 `DROP`
```sql
DROP TABLE Audit_Log;
```
*Removes the Audit_Log table when no longer needed.*

---

## 🔍 2. Simple Analytical Problem Statement

**Problem:**  
> Which user has the most borrow records and what is their total fine amount?

This analysis supports MIS reporting by identifying high-activity users and accountability through fines.

---

## 🧮 3. Procedure: `Get_User_Borrow_History`

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE Get_User_Borrow_History(p_user_id IN NUMBER) IS
  CURSOR c_borrow IS
    SELECT * FROM Borrowing_Records WHERE User_ID = p_user_id;
  v_record Borrowing_Records%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
  OPEN c_borrow;
  LOOP
    FETCH c_borrow INTO v_record;
    EXIT WHEN c_borrow%NOTFOUND;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Borrow ID: ' || v_record.Borrow_ID || ', Status: ' || v_record.Status);
  END LOOP;
  CLOSE c_borrow;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('An error occurred: ' || SQLERRM);
END;
```

🧠 *Fetches borrowing history for a specific user using a cursor and handles errors gracefully.*

---

## 💰 4. Function: `Calculate_User_Fines`

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION Calculate_User_Fines(p_user_id IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
  v_total NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN
  SELECT SUM(Amount) INTO v_total FROM Fines WHERE User_ID = p_user_id AND Paid_Status = 'Unpaid';
  RETURN NVL(v_total, 0);
EXCEPTION
  WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
    RETURN 0;
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error: ' || SQLERRM);
    RETURN -1;
END;
```

*Calculates and returns the total unpaid fines for a user.*

---

## 📦 5. Package: `pkg_user_analytics`

### 📜 Package Specification
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE pkg_user_analytics IS
  PROCEDURE Get_User_Borrow_History(p_user_id IN NUMBER);

    CLOSE c_borrow;
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('An error occurred: ' || SQLERRM);
  END;

  FUNCTION Calculate_User_Fines(p_user_id IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
    v_total NUMBER := 0;
  BEGIN
    SELECT SUM(Amount) INTO v_total FROM Fines WHERE User_ID = p_user_id AND Paid_Status = 'Unpaid';
    RETURN NVL(v_total, 0);
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
      RETURN 0;
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error: ' || SQLERRM);

## 🧪 6. Testing


### 🧪 Examples:
- `EXEC Get_User_Borrow_History(1);`
- `SELECT Calculate_User_Fines(3) FROM DUAL;` 

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

This phase empowered our system with **modular intelligence**. The database is no longer just storage — it’s an active participant in decision-making:

- It **calculates**,  
- It **tracks**,  
- And it **responds**.

With interactive logic, packaged code, and robust error handling, I’ve built a true **MIS-powered backend** that’s future-proof and scalable.

# 🔐 Phase VII: Advanced Database Programming & Auditing  
**📁 Project:** Equipment Borrowing Management System  
**👩‍💻 Student:** Akaliza M. Racia  
**🆔 ID:** 26628  
**📅 Date:** [Insert Date]

## 📘 Phase Cover – What’s Included in Phase VII?

This phase transforms the system into a secure, intelligent, and accountable database environment. By applying advanced PL/SQL programming and auditing techniques, we:
- ⛔ Enforce restricted operations during weekdays and holidays  
- 🔁 Use triggers for real-time rule enforcement  
- 📦 Package logic for automation  
- 📝 Track user actions for audit purposes  

---

## 🧩 1. Problem Statement

**Challenge:**  
> To prevent unauthorized or unintended table manipulations during **weekdays** and **official holidays** in the upcoming month.

**Justification:**  
- Many organizations restrict database access during non-operational days to avoid errors, maintain audit trails, and secure sensitive data.
- Triggers and audit mechanisms ensure **non-invasive enforcement**, real-time logging, and **system accountability**.

---

## 📅 2. Holiday Reference Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Holiday_List (
  Holiday_Date DATE PRIMARY KEY,
  Description VARCHAR2(100)
);
```

### 🎉 Sample Insertions:
```sql
INSERT INTO Holiday_List VALUES (TO_DATE('2025-07-04', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Independence Day');
INSERT INTO Holiday_List VALUES (TO_DATE('2025-07-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Founders Day');
```

---

## 🚫 3. Trigger: Block Table Manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_block_weekday_holiday
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON Borrowing_Records
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
  v_today VARCHAR2(10);
  v_holiday NUMBER;
BEGIN
  SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'DY') INTO v_today FROM DUAL;

  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_holiday
  FROM Holiday_List
  WHERE TRUNC(Holiday_Date) = TRUNC(SYSDATE);

  IF v_today IN ('MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI') OR v_holiday > 0 THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Modifications are blocked on weekdays or public holidays.');
  END IF;
END;
/
```

✅ *Prevents any manipulation of the Borrowing_Records table during weekdays and official holidays in the upcoming month.*

## 📜 4. Audit Table for User Actions

```sql
CREATE TABLE Audit_Log (
  Log_ID NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  User_ID VARCHAR2(50),
  Action_Type VARCHAR2(20),
  Action_Time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP,
  Status VARCHAR2(10)
);
```

---

## 🎯 5. Compound Trigger: Log Actions in Audit Table

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_audit_borrowing
AFTER INSERT OR DELETE OR UPDATE ON Borrowing_Records
COMPOUND TRIGGER

  TYPE t_action_rec IS RECORD (
    user_id VARCHAR2(50),
    action_type VARCHAR2(20),
    status VARCHAR2(10)
  );
  action_data t_action_rec;

AFTER EACH ROW IS
BEGIN
  action_data.user_id := USER;
  action_data.status := 'ALLOWED';
  IF INSERTING THEN
    action_data.action_type := 'INSERT';
  ELSIF UPDATING THEN
    action_data.action_type := 'UPDATE';
  ELSIF DELETING THEN
    action_data.action_type := 'DELETE';
  END IF;
END AFTER EACH ROW;

AFTER STATEMENT IS
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO Audit_Log (User_ID, Action_Type, Status)
  VALUES (action_data.user_id, action_data.action_type, action_data.status);
END AFTER STATEMENT;

END;
/
```

📝 *Records the user, action type, timestamp, and success status of any borrowing table changes.*

---

## 📦 6. Package: Audit Automation Utility

### 📑 Package Spec:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE pkg_audit_utils IS
  PROCEDURE Log_Audit(p_user VARCHAR2, p_action VARCHAR2, p_status VARCHAR2);
END pkg_audit_utils;
/
```

### 💼 Package Body:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY pkg_audit_utils IS
  PROCEDURE Log_Audit(p_user VARCHAR2, p_action VARCHAR2, p_status VARCHAR2) IS
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Audit_Log (User_ID, Action_Type, Status)
    VALUES (p_user, p_action, p_status);
  END;
END pkg_audit_utils;
/
```

🔄 *Allows modular logging of actions from any procedure or trigger.*

---

## 🧪 7. Testing

### ✅ Tested Scenarios:
- ✔️ User attempts INSERT on a **weekday** → **Blocked**
- ✔️ User attempts DELETE on a **holiday** → **Blocked**
- ✔️ User inserts on **Saturday** → **Allowed**
- ✔️ All actions log entries into **Audit_Log**

---

## 🛡️ 8. Security & MIS Alignment

This phase ensures:
- 🔐 **Security:** Data cannot be altered during restricted times
- 🧾 **Accountability:** Every action is logged with who did what and when
- 🤖 **Automation:** No manual checking or enforcement needed
- 📊 **MIS-readiness:** Full traceability for management decisions and compliance

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This phase brings enterprise-level **security, automation, and auditability** to our Equipment Borrowing Management System. With real-time restriction triggers, detailed audit logs, and clean modular procedures, the system is now equipped for professional use and real-world deployment.

It doesn't just store and process data — it **protects it intelligently**. 🛡️🧠
