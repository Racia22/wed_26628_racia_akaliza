# 🧮 Project Title: Equipment Borrowing Management System

**Developer:** Akaliza M. Racia

**Student ID:** 26628


## 📝 Introduction

In educational institutions, research labs, and office environments, equipment like laptops, projectors, and lab tools are frequently borrowed by students or employees. Unfortunately, poor tracking methods often result in lost items, overdue returns, and administrative confusion.

The Equipment Borrowing Management System is designed to solve these issues using a structured, PL/SQL-based solution. It automates the process of borrowing and returning equipment, enforces accountability, and helps organizations maintain better control over their valuable resources.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The main goal of this system is to track the movement of equipment between users and inventory. This includes recording when an item is borrowed, by whom, for how long, and whether it was returned on time. It reduces manual tracking and adds a layer of responsibility for all parties involved.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Automate equipment borrowing and return processes

- ✅ Track each borrowing transaction for transparency

- ✅ Notify users about due dates and overdue items

- ✅ Maintain a database of borrowing records and penalties

 # Phase 3:  🗂 Logical Model Design
 
## 📘 Phase Cover – What’s Included in Phase III?

In Phase III, the focus is on designing a Logical Data Model that reflects both the problem statement defined in Phase I and the business process modeled in Phase II. The logical model will structure data entities, their attributes, relationships, and constraints. This model is foundational for the implementation phase that follows.

## 🎯 Purpose:

 - To define how data will be organized, related, and constrained within the system

 - To reduce redundancy and ensure consistency using normalization principles

 - To visualize relationships between entities before coding begins

## 1️⃣ Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

Below are the core entities, their attributes (with data types), and key designations:

## 👥 Users

| Attribute      | Data Type    | Constraints                   |

| `Return_Date`  | DATE        | NULL (optional)                                                  |
| `Status`       | VARCHAR(20) | DEFAULT 'Borrowed', CHECK IN ('Borrowed', 'Returned', 'Overdue') |

## 💸 Fines

| Attribute     | Data Type     | Constraints                                      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Fine_ID`     | INT           | PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE                    |
| `User_ID`     | INT           | FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(User\_ID), NOT NULL |

| `Reason`      | VARCHAR(150)  | NOT NULL                                         |
| `Paid_Status` | VARCHAR(20)   | DEFAULT 'Unpaid', CHECK IN ('Paid', 'Unpaid')    |

## 2️⃣ Relationships & Constraints

| Relationship          | Type        | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Users ↔ Borrowing     | One-to-Many | A user can have many borrow records           |
| Equipment ↔ Borrowing | One-to-Many | Each equipment can be borrowed multiple times |
| Users ↔ Fines         | One-to-Many | A user can be associated with multiple fines  |

## 3️⃣ Normalization

✅ 1NF – All attributes have atomic values
✅ 2NF – All non-key attributes fully depend on the primary key
✅ 3NF – No transitive dependencies exist; all non-key fields depend only on the PK

Example:

 - Borrowing and fine details are separated into their own tables.

 - Redundancy like repeating user/equipment info in transactions is avoided.

## 4️⃣ Handling Real-World Data Scenarios

## This model accommodates:

 - 🧾 Multiple borrowings by the same user

 - 🔁 Repeated borrowing of the same equipment

 - ⏰ Overdue returns, triggering fines

 - 📬 Future extensions (e.g., automated notifications)

Each entity can scale with more data while maintaining consistency and supporting business rules effectively.

## 5️⃣ Presentation & Feedback

✅ Logical model is designed for clarity and completeness
✅ Well-documented table structures with constraints
✅ Ready for submission and instructor feedback

#### 4. Set the Session Container

```sql
SQL> ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = wed_26628__equipment_borrowing_db;

Session altered.
```

* **Purpose:** Switches the session to the newly created PDB for subsequent operations.


### 5.User Creation and Privilege Assignment

#### Create a Database User

```sql
SQL> CREATE USER akaliza IDENTIFIED BY akaliza;

User created.
```

* **Purpose:** Creates a new user, akaliza, with the password akaliza.

#### Grant Basic Privileges

```sql
SQL> GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, DBA, SYSDBA TO akaliza;

Grant succeeded.
```

*  **Purpose:** To assigns full privileges for database operations.
